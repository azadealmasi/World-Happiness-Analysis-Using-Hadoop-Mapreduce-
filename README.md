# World-Happiness-Analysis-Using-Hadoop-Mapreduce-
This project aims to analyze the changes in happiness scores across different countries over time and identify the factors that have contributed the most to these changes. The primary objective is to gain insights into which countries have experienced the largest shifts in happiness and understand the key drivers behind these changes.

The pursuit of happiness is a basic human desirethat has the power to enhance the overall quality of life(Handayani, Lubis and Ridho Lubis, 2022).In recent years, the notion of happiness has received considerable attention, and several studies have been done to discover the factors that contribute to a country's degree of happiness. The goal of this study is to identify the countries that have seen the greatest changes in happiness scores in recent years, as well as the factors that have contributed the most to these changes. This research will provide vital insights into the elements that have the greatest impact on a country's level of happiness.

 To create a comprehensive data set for the World Happiness Report, wegathered five CSV files, each corresponding to a year from 2015 to 2019. After carefully examining each data set, weremoved any columns that were not common to all years, such as  "Region",  "Family",  "Lower.Confidence.Interval",  and  "Upper.Confidence.Interval",  “Dystopia.Residual”,  “Standard.Error”, “Social.support”, “Whisker.high” and “Whisker.low”.  Wealso standardized the names of some columns to ensure consistency across all data sets. Finally, weaddedthe “year” column, reorganizedthe remaining data columns,and merged them into a single data set, which wenamed "WorldHappiness". This approach allowed usto create a robust and consistent data set for analysis.
